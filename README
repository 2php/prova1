Basic QPSK Modulation

M = 4 (k=2)

Language C/C++

Performance calculation of SER (BER is little different), in AWGN channel.
The gaussian noise is created from the Box-Muller algotithm, easy to implement: 
    this algorithm start from 2 Uniform variable and obtain a gaussian distibution 
    (with the personalization of mean and standard deviation).

No channel coding is applied, so the code rate in my system is 1. I have supposed Es normalized to 1 to simplify calc.

(the channel rate is calculate from shannon theory)

The program generates a stream of 4096x4096 bit, converts them into 4-constellation symbol and then add awgn noise. 
the baseband decoder is a maximum likelihood decoder, in a very simple form.

bit rate/symbol rate is not important, no CR and no SSR (we are in baseband)
