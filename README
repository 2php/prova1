Basic QPSK Modulation

M = 4 (k=2)

Language C/C++

Performance calculation of BER in AWGN channel.
The gaussian noise is created from the Box-Muller algotithm, easy to implement. This algorithm start from 2 Uniform variable and obtain a gaussian distibution (with the personalization of mean and standard deviation).

No channel coding is applied, so the code rate in my system is 1. I have supposed Es normalized to 1 to simplify calc.

the channel rate is calculate from shannon theory.
